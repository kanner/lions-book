\se{File  Systems}

In most computer systems more than  one
peripheral  storage  device is used for
the storage of files. It is now  necessary  to  discuss  a  number of matters
pertaining to the management by UNIX of
the whole set of files and file storage
devices. First, some definitions:

\bd
\item[file system:] an integrated collection  of files with a hierarchical
system of directories recorded  on
a  single  block  oriented storage
device;

\item[storage device:] a device which can
store information (especially disk
pack or DECtape, etc.);

\item[access  device:]  a  mechanism  for
transferring   information  to  or
from a storage device;

\item[a  storage   device]    is    only
{\bf accessible} if it is inserted in an
access device.  In this situation
reference to the storage device is
made via a reference to the access
device;

\item[a storage device] is acceptable  as
a {\bf file system volume} if:

\bd
\item[(a)]  information   is   recorded   as
     addressable  blocks of 512 characters  each,   which   can   be
     independently read or written.

(Note  IBM  compatible  magnetic
tape  does not satisfy this condition.);

\item[(b)] the information recorded  on  the
     device  satisfies  certain  consistency criteria:

block \#1 is formatted as a ``super block'' (see below);

blocks \#2 to \#(n+1)  (where n  is
recorded  in  the ``super block'')
contain an ``inode''  table  which
references all files recorded on
the storage device, and does not
reference any other files;

directory files recorded on  the
storage  device  reference  all,
and  only,  files  on  the  same
storage device, i.e. a file system volume
constitutes  a  self-contained  set  of files,
directories and ``inode'' table;
\ed

\item[a file system volume] is mounted if
the presence of the storage device
in an access device has been  formally  recognised by the operating
system.
\ed


\sbs{The `Super Block'  (5561)}

The ``super block'' is always recorded as
block  \#l on the storage device. (Block
\#0 is always ignored and  is  available
for  miscellaneous uses not necessarily
concerned with UNIX.)

The ``super block'' contains  information
used  in allocating resources, viz. the
storage blocks and the entries  in  the
``inode'' table recorded on the file system. While the file  system  volume  is
mounted  a copy of the ``super block'' is
maintained in core and  updated  there.
To  prevent  the  storage  device  copy
becoming too far out of date, its  contents are written out at regular intervals.


\sbs{The 'mount' table (0272)}

The ``mount'' table  contained  an  entry
for  each  mounted  file system volume.
Each entry defines the device on  which
the  file  system  volume is mounted, a
pointer to the buffer which stores  the
``super  block''  for  the device, and an
``inode'' pointer.  The table  is  referenced as follows:

\bd
\item[iinit (6922)] which  is  called  by
``main''  (1615), makes an entry for
the root device;

\item[smount (6086)]  is  a  system  call
which makes entries for additional
devices;

\item[iget (7276)] searches  the  ``mount''
table  if it encounters an ``inode''
with the `IMOUNT' flag set;

\item[getfs (7167)] searches the  ``mount''
table to find and return a pointer
to the ``super block'' for a particular device;

\item[update (7201)] is  called  periodically  and  searches  the  ``mount''
table to locate information  which
should be written from core tables
into the tables maintained on  the
file system volumes;

\item[sumount (6144)] is  a  system  call
which  deletes  entries  from  the
table.
\ed

\sbs{iinit (6922)}

This routine is called by ``main'' (1615)
to initialise the ``mount'' table entry
for the root device.

\bd
\item[6926:] Call the ``open'' routine for the
      root device. Note that ``rootdev''
      is defined in ``conf.c'' (4695);

\item[6931:] Copy the contents of the root
      device ``super block'' into a
      buffer area not associated with
      any particular device;

\item[6933:] The zeroeth entry in the ``mount''
      table is assigned to the root
      device. Only two of the three
      elements are explicitly initialised. The third, the ``inode''
      pointer, will never be referenced;

\item[6936:] The ``locks'' stored in the ``super
      block'' are explicitly reset.
      (These locks may have been set
      when the ``super block'' was last
      written onto the file system
      volume);

\item[6938:] The root device is mounted
      in a ``writable'' state;

\item[6939:] The system sets its idea of the
      current time and date from the
      time recorded in the ``super
      block''. (If the system has been
      stopped for an appreciable
      period, the computer operator
      will need to reset the contents
      of ``time''.)
\ed

\sbs{Mounting}

From an operational view point, ``mounting''  a  file  system  volume  involves
placing it in a suitable access device,
readying  the device, and then entering
a command such as
parameters.

\begin{verbatim}
    ``/etc/mount /dev/rk2 /rk2''
\end{verbatim}

\noindent to the ``shell'', which forks  a  program
to perform a ``mount'' system call, passing pointers to the two file  names  as
parameters.


\sbs{smount (6086)}

\bd
\item[6093:] ``getmdev'' decodes the first argument  to  locate a block oriented
      access device;

\item[6096:] ``u.u\_dirp'' is  reset  preparatory
to  calling ``namei'' to decode the
second  file  name.   (Note   that
``u.u\_dirp''  is  set  by ``trap'' to
``u.u\_arg[0]'' (2770);

\item[6100:] Check that the file named by  the
      second  parameter  is in a satisfactory condition,  i.e.  no  one
      else  is  currently accessing the
      file, and that the file is not  a
      special  file  (block  or character);

\item[6103:] Search the ``mount'' table  looking
  for      an      empty      entry
  (``mp-$>$m\_bufp==NULL'') or an  entry
  already   made  for  the  device.
  (The ``mount''  data  structure  is
  defined at line 0272);


\item[6111:] ``smp'' should point to a  suitable
entry in the ``mount'' table;

\item[6113:] Perform  the  appropriate  ``open''
routine, with the device name and
a read/write flag  as  arguments.
(As  was  seen  earlier,  for the
RK05 disk the ``open'' routine is a
``no-op'');


\item[6116:] Read block \#1 from the device.
This block is the ``super block'';

\item[6124:] Copy the ``super block'' into a
buffer associated with ``NODEV'',
from the buffer associated with
``d''. The second buffer will not
 be released again until the device is unmounted;

\item[6130:] ``ip'' points to  the  ``inode''  for
the   second  named  file.   This
``inode''   is   now   flagged   as
``IMOUNT''.  The  effect of this is
to force ``iget'' (7292) to  ignore
the  normal contents of the file,
while the file system  volume  is
mounted. (In practice, the second
file is  an  empty  file  created
especially for this purpose.)
\ed


\sbs{Notes}

\bd
\item[1.] The ``read/write'' status of a mounted
device  depends  only on the parameters
provided to ``smount''.   No  attempt  is
made to sense the hardware ``read/write''
status. Thus if a disk is readied  with
``write  protect'' on, but is not mounted
``read only'', then the system will  complain vigorously.

\item[2.] The ``mount'' procedure does not carry
out  any  kind of label checking on the
``mounted'' file system volume.  This  is
reasonable  in  a  situation where file
system volumes are  rarely  rearranged.
However in situations where volumes are
mounted and remounted frequently,  some
means  of  verifying  that  the correct
volume  has  been  mounted  would  seem
desirable.   (Further,  if a file system
volume contains sensitive  information,
it  may  be  desirable  to include some
form of password  protection  as  well.
There  is  room  in  the  ``super block''
(5575) for the storage of a name and an
encrypted password.)
\ed

\sbs{iget (7276)}

This  procedure  is  called  by  ``main''
(1616,1618),  ``unlink'' (3519), ``ialloc''
(7078) and ``namei''  (7534,  7664)  with
two  parameters which together uniquely
identify a  file:  a  device,  and  the
``inode'' number of a file on the device.
``iget'' returns a reference to an  entry
in the core ``inode'' table.


When ``iget'' is called, the core ``inode''
table  is  searched  first to see if an
entry already exists for  the  file  in
the  core  ``inode''  table. If not, then
``iget'' creates one.

\bd
\item[7285:] Search the core ``inode'' table ...

\item[7286:] If an entry  for  the  designated
file already exists ...

\item[7287:] Then if it is locked go to sleep;


\item[7290:] Try again. (Note the whole  table
  needs  to  be searched again from
  the beginning, because the  entry
  may have vanished!);

\item[7292:] If the IMOUNT flag  is  on  ...
this  is an important possibility
for which we will delay the  discussion;

\item[7302:] If the ``IMOUNT'' flag is not  set,
increase  the  ``inode''  reference
count, set the ``ILOCK''  flag  and
return a pointer to the ``inode'';


\item[7306:] Make a note of  the  first  empty
      slot in the ``inode'' table;

\item[7309:] If the  ``inode''  table  is  full,
      send  a  message to the operator,
      and take an error exit;

\item[7314:] At this point, a new entry is  to
      be made in the ``inode'' table;

\item[7319:] Read the block which contains the
      file  system volume ``inode''. Note
      the use  of  ``bread''  instead  of
      ``readi'',   the   assumption  that
      ``inode''  information  begins   in
      block \#2  and the convention that
      valid ``inode''  numbers  begin  at
      one (not zero);

\item[7326:] A read error at this point isn't
      very well reported to the rest of       
      the system; 

\item[7328:] Copy the relevant ``inode'' 
information.  This code makes implicit
      use of the contents of  the  file
      ``ino.h''  (Sheet  56), which isn't
      referenced explicitly anywhere.
\ed

\noindent Let us now return to  unfinished  business:

\bd
\item[7292:] The ``IMOUNT'' flag is found to  be
      set.   This   flag   was  set  by
``smount'',  when  a  file   system
volume was mounted;

\item[7293:] Search the ``mount'' table to  find
      the  entry  which  points  to the
      current    ``inode''.     (Although
      searching  this  table  is  not a
      horrendous overhead, it does seem
      possible  that  a  ``back pointer''
      could be conveniently  stored  in
      in   the   ``inode''  e.g.  in  the
      ``i\_lastr'' field. This would  save
      both time and code space.;

\item[7396:] Reset  ``dev''  and  ``ino''  to  the
      mounted  device  number  and  the
      ``inode'' number of the root directory  on  the mounted file system
      volume.  Start again.
\ed


Clearly,  since  ``iget''  is  called  by
``namei''  (7534,  7664),  this technique
allows the whole directory structure on
the  mounted  file  system volume to be
integrated into the pre-existing directory   structure.   If  we  momentarily
ignore  the  possible   deviations   of
directory  structures  away  from  tree
structures, we have the situation where
a  leaf  of  the existing tree is being
replaced by an entire subtree.


\sbs{getfs (7167)}

There is little that needs to be said
 about this procedure in addition to the
author's comment. This procedure is called by

\begin{verbatim}
   access   (6754)     ialloc   (7072)
   alloc    (6961)     ifree    (7138)
   free     (7004)     iupdat   (7383)
\end{verbatim}


Note the  cunning  use  of  ``n1'',  ``n2''
which   are   declared   as   character
pointers  i.e.  as  unsigned  integers.
This allows only one sided tests on the
two variables at line 7177.

\sbs{update (7201)}

The function of this procedure, in  its
broadest   terms,  is  to  ensure  that
information on the file system  volumes
is  kept  up  to date.  The comment for
this procedure (beginning on line 7190)
describes the three main sub-functions,
(in the reverse order!).

``update'' is the whole business  of  the
``sync''  system call (3486). This may be
invoked via the ``sync''  shell  command.
Alternatively  there is a standard system program
which runs continuously and
whose  only  function is to call ``sync''
every 30 seconds.  (See  ``UPDATE(VIII)''
in the UPM.)


``update'' is called by ``sumount''  (6150)
before   a   file   system   volume  is
unmounted, and by ``panic'' (2420) as the
last   action   of  the  system  before
activity ceases.

\bd
\item[7207:] If another execution of  ``update''
      is under way, then just return;

\item[7210:] Search the ``mount'' table;

\item[7211:] For each mounted volume, ...

\item[7213:] Unless the file  system  has  not
      been  recently  modified  or  the
      ``super block'' is  locked  or  the
      volume  has  been  mounted  ``read
      only'' ...

\item[7217:] Update the ``super block'', copy it
      into   a  buffer  and  write  the
      buffer out onto the volume;

\item[7223:] Search the ``inode'' table, and for
      each  non-null  entry,  lock  the
      entry and call ``iupdat'' to update
      the  ``inode''  entry on the volume
      if appropriate;

\item[7229:] Allow  additional  executions  of
      ``update'' to commence;

\item[7230:] ``bflush'' (5229)  forces  out  any
      ``delayed write'' blocks.
\ed

\sbs{sumount (6144)}

This system call deletes an entry for a
mounted  device from the ``mount'' table.
The purpose of this call is  to  ensure
that  traffic to and from the device is
terminated properly, before the storage
device  is  physically removed from the
access device.

\bd
\item[6154:] Search the ``mount'' table for  the
      appropriate entry;

\item[6161:] Search the ``inode'' table for  any
      outstanding  entries for files on
      the device. If  any  such  exist,
      take  an  error  exit, and do not
      change the ``mount'' table entry;

\item[6168:] Clear the ``IMOUNT'' flag.
\ed


\sbs{Resource Allocation}

Our attention now turns to the  management  of the resources of an individual
FSV (file system volume).


Storage blocks are allocated  from  the
free  list by ``alloc'' at the request of
``bmap''.  Storage blocks are returned to
the  free  list by ``free'' at the behest
of ``itrunc'' (which is called by ``core'',
``open1'' and ``iput'').


Entries in the FSV ``inode''  tables  are
made  by  ``ialloc'',  which is called by
``maknode'' and ``pipe''. Entries  in  this
table  are  cancelled by ``ifree'', which
is called by ``iput''.


The ``super block'' for the FSV  is  central  to  the  resource management procedures.  The ``super block'' (5561) contains:

\bi
\item size  information (total resources available);

\item list of up to 100  available  storage blocks;

\item list of up to 100  available  ``inode'' entries;

\item locks to control manipulation of  the above lists;

\item flags;

\item current date of last update.
\ei


If the list in core of available
``inode'' entries for the file system
volume ever becomes exhausted, then the
entire table on the FSV is read and
searched to rebuild the list. Conversely if the available ``inode'' table
overflows, additional entries are simply forgotten to be rediscovered later.


A different strategy is used for the
list of available storage blocks.
These blocks are arranged in groups of
up to one hundred blocks. The first
block in each group (except the very
first) is used to store the addresses
of the blocks belonging to the previous
group. Addresses of blocks in the last
incomplete group are stored in the
``super block''.

The first entry in the first list of
block numbers is zero, which acts as a
sentinel. Since the whole list is subject to a LIFO discipline, discovery of
a block number of zero in the list signifies that the list is in fact empty.


\sbs{alloc (6965)}

This is called by ``bmap'' (6435, 6448,
6468, 6480, 6497) whenever a new
storage block is needed to store part
of a file.

\bd
\item[6961:] Convert knowledge of the device
      name into a pointer to the ``super
      block'';

\item[6962:] If ``s\_flock'' is set, the list of
      available blocks is currently
      being updated by another process;

\item[6967:] Obtain the block  number  of  the
      next available storage block;

\item[6968:] If the last block number  on  the
      list  is zero, the entire list is
      now empty;

\item[6970:] ``badblock''  (7040)  is  used   to
      check   that   the  block  number
      obtained from the list seems reasonable;

\item[6971:] If the list of  available  blocks
      in   the  ``super  block''  is  now
      empty,  then   the   block   just
      located    will    contain    the
      addresses of the  next  group  of blocks.

\item[6972:] Set ``s\_flock'' to delay any  other
  process from getting a ``no space''
  indication  before  the  list  of
  available  blocks  in  the ``super
  block'' can be replenished;

\item[6975:] Determine  the  number  of  valid
entries in the list to be copied;

\item[6978:] Reset  ``s\_flock'',  and   ``wakeup''
      anyone waiting;

\item[6982:] Clear  the  buffer  so  that  any
      information  recorded in the file
      by default will be all zeros;

\item[6983:] Set the ``modified'' flag to ensure
      that  the  ``super  block'' will be
      written out by ``update'' (7213).
\ed

\sbs{itrunc (7414)}

This  procedure  is  called  by  ``core''
(4112),   ``open1''   (5825)  and  ``iput''
(7353). In the  first  two  cases,  the
contents  of the ``file'' are about to be
replaced.  In the third case, the  file
is about to be abandoned.

\bd
\item[7421:] If the file  is  a  character  or
      block  special file then there is
      nothing to do;

\item[7423:] Search  backwards  the  list   of
      block   numbers   stored  in  the
      ``inode'';

\item[7425:] If the file is large,  then  an
indirect fetch is needed. (A double indirect fetch is needed  for
blocks    numbered    seven   and
higher.);


\item[7427:] Reference all {\bf 257} elements of the
  buffer  in  reverse  order. (Note
  this seems to be the  only  place
  where  characters  \#512,  \#513 of
  the buffer area  are  referenced.
  Since  they  will presumably contain zero, they  will  contribute
  nothing to the calculation. Hence
  if  ``510''  were  substituted  for
  ``512''  here,  and  again  on line
  7432, a general  improvement  all
  round would result (?));


\item[7438:] ``free''  returns   an   individual
      block to the available list;


\item[7439:] This is  the  end  of  the  ``for''
      statement   commencing   on  line
      7427.   (Likewise  the  statement
      which  begins  at  7432  ends  at
      7435.);


\item[7443:] Clear the entry in ``i\_addr[ ]'';


\item[7445:] Reset size information, and  flag
      the ``inode'' as ``updated''.
\ed



\sbs{free (7000)}


This procedure is  called  by  ``itrunc''
(7435, 7438, 7442) to reinsert a simple
storage block into the  available  list
for a device.

\bd
\item[7005:] It is not clear why the ``s\_fmod'' flag
is set here as well as at the end of  the  procedure  (line
7026). Any suggestions?

\item[7006:] Observe the locking protocol;


\item[7010:] If  no  free  blocks   previously
      existed  for  the device, restore
      the situation by setting up a one
      element  list containing an entry
      for block \#0.   This  value  will
      subsequently be interpreted as an
      ``end of list'' sentinel;

\item[7014:] If  the  available  list  in  the
      ``super block'' is already full, it
      is time to write it out onto  the
      FSV. Set ``s\_flock'';


\item[7016:] Get a buffer, associated with the
      block  now  being  entered in the
	free list;

\item[7019:] Copy the contents  of  the  super
      block  list,  preceded by a count
      of the number  of  valid  blocks,
      into   the   buffer;   write  the
      buffer;  unset   the   lock   and
      ``wakeup'' anybody waiting,


\item[7025:] Add the  returned  block  to  the
      available list.
\ed


\sbs{iput (7344)}


This procedure is one of the most popular  in UNIX (called from nearly thirty
different places) and its use will have
already been frequently observed.


In essence  it  simply  decrements  the
reference  count for the ``inode'' passed
as a parameter, and then calls  ``prele''
(7882) to reset the ``inode'' lock and to
perform any necessary ``wakeup''s.


``iput'' has an important side effect. If
the  reference  count  is  going  to be
reduced to  zero,  then  a  release  of
resources  is  indicated.  This  may be
simply the core ``inode'', or  both  that
and  the  file itself, if the number of
links is also zero.



\sbs{ifree (7134)}


This  procedure  is  called  by  ``iput''
(7355)  to  return a FSV ``inode'' to the
available list maintained in the ``super
block''.  If  this  list is already full
(as noted above)  or  if  the  list  is
locked  (using  ``s\_ilock'') the information is simply discarded.

\sbs{iupdat (7374)}


This procedure  is  called  by ``stat1''
(6050),   ``update''  (7226)  and  ``iput''
(7357) to revise a  particular  ``inode''
entry  on a FSV. It does nothing if the
corresponding  core  ``inode''   is   not
flagged (``IUPD'' or ``IACC'');


The ``IUPD'' flag may be set by one of

\begin{verbatim}
  unlink (3530)        bmap (6452,6467)
  chmod  (3570)        itrunc  (7448)
  chown  (3583)        maknode (7462)
  link   (5942)        namei   (7609)
  writei (6285,6318)   pipe    (7751)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The ``IACC'' flag may be set by one of

\begin{verbatim}
  readi  (6232)       maknode (7462)
  writei (6285)       pipe    (7751)
\end{verbatim}


The flags are reset by ``iput'' (7359).

\bd
\item[7383:] Forget it, if the  FSV  has  been
mounted as ``read only'';


\item[7386:] Read the appropriate  block  containing  the  FSV  ``inode'' entry.
      As observed earlier with  respect
      to  ``iget'',  note  the the use of
      ``bread'' instead of  ``readi'',  the
      assumption that the ``inode'' table
      begins at block \#2 and  the  convention    that   valid   ``inode''
      numbers begin at one;


\item[7389:] Copy  the  relevant   information
