\se{Interactive Terminals}

Our remaining task, to be completed in
this and the following chapter, is to
consider the code which controls
interactive terminals (or ``terminals'',
for short).

A wide variety of terminals is available and several different types may be
simultaneously attached to a single
computer. Distinguishing characteristics for different classes of terminal
include (besides such non-essential
features as shape, size and colour):

\bd
\item[(a)] transmission speed, e.g. 110
baud for an ASR33 teletype, 300
baud for a DECwriter, 2400 baud
or 9600 baud for a Visual
Display unit (``VD'');

\item[(b)] graphic character set, notably
the full ASCII graphic set and
the 64 graphic subset;

\item[(c)] transmission parity: odd, even,
none or inoperatlve;

\item[(d)] output technique:  serial printer
or visual display;

\item[(e)] miscellaneous: combined carriage
return/line feed character, half
duplex terminal (input characters do not need echoing);
recognition of tab characters;

\item[(f)] characteristic delays for certain control functions, e.g.
carriage returns may not be completed within a single character
transmission time, etc.
\ed

As well as the wide variety of terminals which are available and in use,
there is also a variety of hardware
devices which may be used to interface
a terminal to a PDP 11 computer. For example:

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
DL11/KL11 & single line, asynchronous\\
	  & interface; 13 standard\\
	  & transmission rates between\\
	  & 40 and 9600 baud;\\
\\
DJ11 & 16 line, asynchronous, buffered\\
	& serial line multiplexer; 11\\
	& speeds between 75 and 9600 baud,\\
	& selectable in four line groups;\\
\\
DH11 & 16 line, asynchronous, buffered,\\
	&  serial line multiplexer; 14 speeds,\\
	& individually selectable; DMA \\
	& transmission\\
\end{tabular}

Each of the above interfaces will work
in full or half duplex mode; handle 5,
6, 7 or 8 level codes; generate odd,
even or no parity; and generate a stop
code of 1, 1.5 or 2 bits.

In addition to the above asynchronous
interfaces, there are a number of synchronous interfaces, e.g. DQ11.

Each interface has its own control
characteristics and it requires a
separate operating system device
driver. The common code which can be
shared between these is gathered into a
single file ``tty.c'', to be found on
Sheets 81 to 85. A set of common definitions is gathered in the file ``tty.h''
on Sheet 79.

By way of example, Sheet 80 contains
the file ``kl.c'', which constitutes the
device driver for a set of DL11/KL11
interfaces. This device driver always
needs to be present, since one KL11
interface is invariably included in a
system for the the operator's console
terminal.

\sbs{The 'tty' Structure (7926)}

An instance of ``tty'' is associated with
every terminal port to the system (no
matter what type of hardware interface
is used). A ``port'' in this context is a
place to attach a terminal line. Hence
a DL11 supplies only one port, whereas
a DJ11 supplies up to sixteen ports.

The ``tty'' structure consists of sixteen
words and includes:

\noindent\begin{tabular}{lll}\\
A. & t\_dev & fixed for a particular \\
   & t\_addr & terminal port;\\
\\
B. &  t\_speeds & fixed for a particular \\
  & t\_erase & terminal. These values may \\
  & t\_kill & be set by ``stty'' and \\
  & t\_flags & interrogated by ``gtty''; \\
 \\
C. & t\_rawq & list heads for {\bf three} \\
  & t\_canq & character queues: the \\
  & t\_outq & so-called ``raw'' input, \\
 & & ``cooked'' input and the \\
 & & output queues; \\
 \\
D. & t\_state & status information which \\
  & t\_delct & changes frequently during \\
  & t\_col & normal processing; \\
  & t\_char & \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{center}
{\large \bf Table 24.1}
\end{center}

\sbs{ Interactive Terminals}

The reader should study the information
on Sheet 79 carefully. Certain items
listed below are not referenced in any
essential way in the selection of code
examined here.

\begin{verbatim}
   t_char    (7940)    NLDELAY   (7974)
   t_speeds  (7941)    TBDELAY   (7975)
   HUPCL     (7966)    CRDELAY   (7976)
   ODDP      (7972)    WOPEN     (7985)
   EVENP     (7973)    ASLEEP    (7993)
\end{verbatim}

\sbs{Initialisation}

Initialisation of the ``tty'' structures
is the responsibility of the various
``open'' routines in the device drivers,
for example, ``klopen'' (8023).

The items in Group B of Table 24.1 may
be changed by a ``stty'' system call.
The current values may be interrogated
by a ``gtty'' system call.

A description of these is contained in
the sections, ``STTY(II)'' and ``GTTY(II)''
of the UPM. These calls are invoked by
the ``stty'' shell command which is
described in the section ``STTY(I)''.

Since the ``stty'' and ``gtty'' system
calls require a file descriptor as a
parameter, they can only be applied to
an ``open'' character special file.

The two system calls share a good deal
of common code. We will trace the progress of an execution of ``stty'' below
and leave the tracing of a similar execution of ``gtty'' to the reader.

\sbs{stty (8183)}

This procedure implements the ``stty''
system call. It copies three words of
user parameter information into
``u.u\_arg[..]'' using the parameter supplied as a pointer, and then calls
``sgtty''.

\sbs{sgtty (8201)}

\bd
\item[8206:] Get a validated pointer to  a
``file'' array entry;

\item[8209:] Check that the file is a ``character special'';

\item[8213:] Call the appropriate ``d\_sgtty''
routine for the device type. (See
Sheet 46.)
\ed

Note that the ``d\_sgtty'' routine is
``nodev'' for the line printer and paper
tape reader/punch.

\sbs{klsgtty (8090)}

This is an example of a ``d\_sgtty'' routine. It calls ``ttystty'' passing a
pointer to the appropriate ``tty'' structure as a parameter.

\sbs{tysty (8577)}

A call originating from ``stty'' will
have a second parameter of zero.

\bd
\item[8589:] Empty all the queues associated
with the terminal forthwith. They
quite likely contain nonsense;

\item[8591:] Reset the speed information (useful in the
case of a DH11 interface, but of little interest for
the present selection of code);

Reset the ``erase'' character and
the ``kill'' character. (``kill''
here denotes ``throw away the
current input line''.) Note that
if these characters are changed
away from their normal values of
``\#'' and ``@'' respectively, no
corresponding changes are made to
``maptab''. Nor should they!),

\item[8593:] Reset the ``flags'' defining some
relevant terminal characteristics
(see Sheet 79):

\noindent\begin{tabular}{lll}\\
{\bf flag} &  {\bf bit} & {\bf if set ...}\\
 \\
XTABS & 1 & the terminal will not interpret \\
& & horizontal tab characters\\
& &  correctly; \\
 \\
LCASE & 2 & the terminal supports only the \\
& & 64 character ASCII subset; \\
 \\
ECHO & 3 & the terminal is operating in \\
& & full duplex mode, and input \\
& & characters must be echoed \\
& & back; \\
 \\
CRMOD & 4 & upon input, a ``carriage \\
& & return'' is replaced by a \\
& & ``line feed''; upon output, a\\
& & ``line feed'' is replaced by a\\
& & ``carriage return'' and a ``line\\
& &  feed''; \\
 \\
RAW & 5 & input characters are to be \\
& & sent to the program exactly \\
& & as received, without ``erase''\\
& & or``kill'' processing, or\\
& & adjustment for backslash\\
& & characters. \\
\end{tabular}

In addition, the following bits are
interrogated by ``ttyoutput'' (8373) in
choosing the delay which should ensue
after the character indicated is sent,
before sending the next character:


\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
8,9 & line feed;\\
10,11 & horizontal tab;\\
12,13 & carriage return;\\
14 & vertical tab or form feed.\\
\end{tabular}
\ed

\sbs{The DL11/KL11 Terminal Device Handler}

The file ``kl.c'' constitutes the device
handler for terminals connected to the
system via DL11/KL11 interfaces. This
group always has at least one member -- the operator's console terminal. Hence
this device handler will always be
present.

Each DL11/KL11 hardware controller provldes an asynchronous, serial interface
to connect a single terminal to a PDP
11 system. For more complete details
regarding this interface the reader
should consult the ``PDP11 Peripherals
Handbook''.

\sbs{Device Registers}

Each DL11/RL11 unit has a group of four
registers occupying four consecutive
words on the UNIBS. UNIX maps a
structure of type ``klregs'' (8016) onto
each register group.

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Receiver Status Register (klrcsr)} \\
bit 7 & {\bf Receiver Done.} (A character has\\
      & been transferred into the\\
      & Receiver Data Buffer Register.);\\
\\
bit 6 & {\bf Receiver Interrupt Enable.}\\
      & (When set, an interrupt is\\
      & caused every time bit 7 is set.);\\
\\
bit 1 & {\bf Data terminal ready;}\\
\\
bit 0 & {\bf Reader Enable. Write only.}\\
      & (When set, bit 7 is cleared.).\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Receiver Data Buffer Register (klrbuf)} \\
bit 15 & Error indication, when set.\\
\\
bits 7-0 & Received character, Read\\
         & only.\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Transmitter Status Register (kltcsr)} \\
bit 7 & {\bf Transmitter ready.} This is\\
      & cleared when data is loaded\\
      & into the Transmitter Data\\
      & Buffer, and is set when the\\
      & latter is ready to receive\\
      & another character;\\
\\
bit 6 & {\bf Transmitter Interrupt Enable.}\\
     & (when set, causes an\\
     & interrupt to be generated\\
     & whenever bit 7 is set.)\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\bf Transmitter Data Buffer Register (kltbuf)} \\
bits 7-0 & Transmitted data. Write only.\\
\end{tabular}

\sbs{UNIBUS Addresses}

The Receiver Status Register always has
its lowest address starting on a four
word boundary. (The addresses which
follow are all 18 bit octal addresses.)

\noindent\begin{tabular}{lll}\\
 & {\bf Receiver} & {\bf Transmitter}\\
 & {\bf Status} & {\bf Status}\\
Operator's console & 777560 $\rightarrow$ & 777566\\
\\
Group Two & 776500 $\rightarrow$ & 776506\\
	& 776510 $\rightarrow$ & 77656 \\ \cline{2-3}
	& 776670 $\rightarrow$ & 776676\\
\\
Group Three & 775610 $\rightarrow$ & 775616\\
        & 775620 $\rightarrow$ & 775626 \\ \cline{2-3}
        & 776170 $\rightarrow$ & 776176\\
\end{tabular}

Apart from the operator's console
interface which has its own standard
UNIBUS location, the interfaces are
gathered into two groups (for reasons
which are irrelevant here). Within
each group, by convention, registers
are allocated in consecutive locations
starting at the lowest address.

\sbs{Software Considerations}

``NKL11'' (8011) must be set to define,
for a particular installation, the
number of interfaces in the first two
groups, and ``NDL11'' (8012), the nmber
in the third group. Any hardware
alterations which changed the actual
number of interfaces would have to be
reflected in the software by changing
and recomiling ``kl.c'', and relinking
the operaing system.

It will be seen that ``klopen'' calculates the correct kernel mode address
(16 bits) for the Receiver Status
Register for each interface, and this
is stored (8044) into the the ``t\_addr''
element of the appropriate ``tty'' structure.

\sbs{Interrupt Vector Addresses}

The vector addresses for the first
interface are 060 and 064 (for receiver
and transmitter interrupts, respectively).
Additional DL11/KL11 interfaces have vector addresses which are
always at least 0300, and which are
assigned according to rules which take
into consideration other interfaces
which may be present.

The second word of an interrupt doublet
is the ``new processor status'' word. The
five low order bits of this word may be
chosen arbitrarily, and are in fact
used to define the minor device number
(cf. a similar use to distinguish the
various kinds of ``traps'' -- see Sheet
05). A masked version of the new processor status word is provided to the
interrupt handling routines as the
parameter ``dev'' (see e.g. line 8070).

\sbs{Source Code}

We can now turn to a detailed study of
the code in the files ``kl.c'' (Sheet 80)
and ``tty.c'' (Sheets 81 to 85). We
shall look first at ``opening'' and
``closing'' terminals as character
special files and the handling of interrupts. Then in the next chapter we
shall look at the receipt of data from
the terminal, and finally transmission
of data to the terminal.

``klread'' (8062), ``klwrite'' (8066) and
``klsgtty'' (8090) have already been discussed above.

\sbs{klopen (8023)}

This procedure is called to ``open'' a
terminal as a character special file.
This call is usually made by the program ``/etc/init'' for each terminal
which is to be active in the system.
Since child processes inherit the open
files of their parents, it is not usually necessary for other processes to
``open'' the device again. It will be
noted that the there is no attempt to
stop two unrelated processes having the
terminal as an open file simultaneously.

\bd
\item[8026:] Check the minor device number;

\item[8030:] Locate the appropriate ``tty''
structure;

\item[8031:] If the process opening the file
has no associated controlling
terminal designate the current
terminal for this role. (Note
that the reference stored is the
address of a ``tty'' structure.):

\item[8033:] Store the terminal device number
in the ``tty'' structure

\item[8039:] Calculate the address of the
appropriate set of device registers for the
terminal and store

\item[8045:] If the terminal is not already
``open'', do some initialisation of
the ``tty'' structure ..

\item[8046:] ``t\_state'' is set to show the file
is ``open'', so that the next three
lines will not be executed if the
file is opened a second time,
possibly undoing the effect of a
``stty'' system call:

``t\_state'' is also set to show
``CARR\_ON'' (``carrier on''). This is
a software flag which shows that
the terminal is logically
enabled, regardless of the true
hardware status of the terminal.
If ``CARR\_ON'' is reset for a terminal, the system {\bf should} ignore
all input from the terminal.

(This does not seem to be
entirely true, and this point
will be taken up again later.);

\item[8047:] The standard terminal is assumed
to be unable to interpret horizontal tabs, to support only the
64 character ASCII subset, to run
in full duplex mode and to
require both ``carriage return''
and ``line feed'' characters to
provide normal ``new line'' processing. (Could this be a Model
33 teletype?);

\item[8048:] The ``erase'' and ``kill'' characters
are set according to the UNIX
convention;

\item[8051:] The Receiver Control Status
register is initialised with the
pattern ``0103'' so that the terminal is made ready, reading is
enabled and receiver interrupts
are enabled;

\item[8052:] The Transmitter Control Status
register is initialised so that
an interrupt will be generated
whenever the interface is ready
to receive another character.
\ed

Note that the ``open'' routine does not
distinguish between the cases where the
file is opened for reading only, or
writing only, or for both reading and
writing.

\sbs{klclose (8055)}

\bd
\item[8057:] Find the address of the appropriate ``tty''
structure in the array
of such structures, ``kl11''
(8015). (This operation may be
observed in all the procedures in
the second column of Sheet 80,
and its relevance should be
noted.)

\item[8058:] ``wflushtty'' (8217) allows   the
output queue for the terminal to
``drain'' and then flushes the
input queue

\item[8059:] ``t\_state'' is reset so that ``ISOPEN''
and\\ ``CARR\_ON'' are no longer
true.
\ed

\sbs{klxint (8070)}

This procedure is executed in response
to a transmitter interrupt. It should
be compared with ``pcpint'' (8739) and
``lpint'' (8976). Note that the parameter
``dev'' is a masked version (low order
five bits preserved) of the ``new processor status'' word in the interrupt
vector. Provided the vector was properly initialised, the minor device
number will be properly identified.

The second part of the test on line
8074 will be discussed at the end of
the next chapter.

\sbs{klrint (8078)}

This procedure is executed in response
to a receiver interrupt. It is not so
readily compared with ``pcrint'' (8719)
although similarities certainly exist.

\bd
\item[8083:] Read the input character from the
Receiver Data Buffer register;

\item[8084:] Enable the receiver for the next
character;

\item[8085:] The comment says ``hardware
botch''. Better believe it;

\item[8086:] Pass the character to ``ttyinput''
to insert it into the appropriate
``raw'' input queue.
\ed
