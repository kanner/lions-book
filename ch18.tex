{\noindent \Large Section Four}

{\sf Section Four is concerned with files
and file systems.

A file system is a set of files and
associated tables and directories
organised onto a single storage device
such as a disk pack.

This section covers the means of
creating and accessing files,
locating files via directories, and
organising and maintaining
file systems.

It also includes the code for an exotic
breed of file called a ``pipe''.
}


\se{File Access and Control}


A large part of every operating system
seems to be concerned with data management and file management, and UNIX
turns out to be no exception.


Section Four of the source code contains thirteen files.


The first four contain common declarations needed by various of the other
routines:

\bd
\item[``file.h''] describes the structure
of the ``file'' array;

\item[``filsvs.h''] describes the structure
of the ``super block'' for ``mounted''
file systems;

\item[``ino.h''] describes the structure of
``inodes'' recorded on ``mounted''
devices;

\item[``inode.h''] describes the structure
of the ``inode'' array;
\ed

The next two files, ``sys2.c'' and
``sys3.c'' contain code for system calls.
(``sys1.c'' and ``sys4.c'' were presented
in Section Two).

The next five files, ``rdwri.c'',
``subr.c'', ``fio.c'', ``alloc.c'' and
``iget.c'', together present the principal routines for file management, and
provide a link between the i/o oriented
system calls and the basic i/o routines.

The file ``nami.c'' is concerned with
searching directories to convert file
pathnames into ``inode'' references.

Finally, ``pipe.c'' is the ``device
driver'' for pipes.

\sbs{File Characteristics}


A UNIX file is conceptually a named
character string, stored on one of a
variety of peripheral devices (or in
the main memory), and accessible via
mechanisms appropriate to the usual
peripheral devices.

It will be noted that there is no
record structure associated with UNIX
files. However ``newline'' characters may
be inserted into the file to define
substrings analogous to records.
 
UNIX carries the ideas of device
independence to their logical extreme
by allowing the file name in effect to
determine uniquely all relevant attributes of the file.


\sbs{System Calls}

The following system calls are provided
expressly for file manipulation:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
{\bf \#} & {\bf Name} & {\bf Line \hspace{0.5cm}} & {\bf \#} & {\bf Name} & {\bf Line}\\ \hline
3 & read & 5711 & 14 & mknod & 5952\\
4 & write & 5720 & 15 & chmod & 3560\\
5 & open & 5765 & 16 & chown & 3575\\
6 & close & 5846 & 19 & seek & 5861\\
8 & creat & 5781 & 21 & mount & 6086\\
9 & link & 5909 & 22 & umount & 6144\\
10 & unlink & 3510 & 41 & dup & 6069\\
12 & chdir & 3538 & 42 & pipe & 7723\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\sbs{Control Tables}

The arrays ``file'' and ``inode'' are
essential components of the file access
mechanism.

\sbs{file (5507)}

The array ``file'' is defined as an array
of structures (also named ``file'').

An element of the ``file'' array is considered to be unallocated if ``f\_count''
is zero.

Each ``open'' or ``creat'' system call
results in the allocation of an element
of the ``file'' array. The address of
this element is stored in an element of
the calling process's array
``u.u\_ofile''. It is the index of the
newly allocated element of the latter
array which is passed back to the user
process. Descendants of a process
created by ``newproc'' inherit the
contents of the parent's ``u.u\_ofile''
array.


Each element of ``file'' includes a
counter, ``f\_count'', to determine the
number of current processes which
reference it.

``f\_count'' is incremented by ``newproc''
(1878), ``dup'' (6079) and ``falloc''
(6857); it is decremented by ``closef''
(6657) and (if the file can't be
opened) by ``open1'' (5836).

The ``f\_flag'' (5509) of the ``file'' element notes whether the file is open for
reading and/or writing or whether it is
a ``pipe'' or not. (Further discussion of
``pipes'' will be deferred till Chapter
Twenty-One.)

The ``file'' structure also contains a
pointer, ``f\_inode'' (5511) to an entry
in the ``inode'' table, and a 32 bit
integer, ``f\_offset'' (5512), which is a
logical pointer to a character within
the file.


\sbs{inode (5659)}

``inode'' is defined as an array of
structures (also named ``inode'').


An element of the ``inode''
is considered to be unallocated if the reference
count, ``i\_count'', is zero.

At each point in time, ``inode'' contains
a single entry for each file which may
be referenced for normal i/o operations, or which is being executed or
which has been executed and has the
``sticky'' bit set, or which is the working directory for some process.


Several ``file'' table entries may point
to a single ``inode'' entry. The inode
entry describes the general disposition
of the file.

\sbs{Resources Required}

Each file requires the dedication of
certain system resources. When a file
exists, but is not being referenced in
any way, it requires:

\bd
\item[(a)] a directory entry (16 characters
 in a directory file);

\item[(b)] a disk ``inode'' entry (32 characters in a table stored on the
disk);

\item[(c)] zero, one or more blocks of disk
 storage (512 characters each).
\ed


\noindent In addition if the file is being referenced for some purpose, it requires

\bd
\item[(d)] a core ``inode'' entry (32 characters in the ``inode'' array);
\ed


\noindent Finally if a user program has ``opened''
the file for reading or writing, a
number of resources are required:

\bd
\item[(e)] a ``file'' array entry (8 characters);

\item[(f)] an entry in the user program's
``u.u\_ofile'' array (one word per
file, pointing to a ``file'' array
entry);
\ed


Mechanisms have to be set up for allocating and deallocating each of these
resources in an orderly manner. The
following table gives the names of the
principal procedures involved:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
{\bf resource} & {\bf obtain} & {\bf free} \\ \hline
directory entry & namei & namei\\
disk ``inode'' entry & ialloc & ifree\\
disk storage block & alloc & free\\
core ``inode'' entry & iget & iput\\
``file'' table entry & falloc & closef\\
``u\_ofile'' entry & ufalloc & close\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\sbs{Opening a File}

When a program wishes to reference a
file which already exists, it must
``open'' the file to create a ``bridge'' to
the file. (Note that in UNIX,
processes usually inherit the open
files of their parents or predecessors,
so that often all needed files are
already implicitly open.) If the file
does not already exist, it must be
``created''.


This second case will be investigated
first:


\sbs{creat (5781)}

\bd
\item[5786:] ``namei'' (7518) converts a pathname into an ``inode'' pointer.
 ``uchar'' is the name of a procedure which recovers the pathname, character by character,
 from the user program data area;

\item[5787:] A null ``inode'' pointer indicates
 either an error or that no file
 of that name already exists;

\item[5788:] For error conditions, see ``CREAT
 (II)'' in the UPM;

\item[5790:] ``maknode'' (7455) creates a core
 ``inode'' via a call on ``ialloc''
 and then initialises it and
 enters it into the appropriate
 directory. Note the explicit
 resetting of the ``sticky'' bit
\ed


\sbs{open1 (5804)}

This procedure is called by ``open''
(5774) and ``creat'' (5793, 5795), passing values of the third parameter,
``trf'', of 0, 2 and 1 respectively. The
value 2 represents the case where no
file of the desired name already
exists.

\bd
\item[5812:] The second parameter, ``mode'', can
 take the values 01 (``FREAD''), 02
(``FWRITE'') or 03 (``FREAD \verb+|+ FWRITE'')
when ``trf'' is 0, but only 02 otherwise;

Whete a file of the desired name
already exists, check the access
permissions for the desired
mode(s) of activity via calls on
``access'' (6746), which may set
``u.u\_error'' as a side-effect;

\item[5824:] If the file is being ``created'',
 eliminate its previous contents
 via a call on ``itrunc'' (7414).
 The code here could be improved
 by changing the test to ``(trf ==
 1)''. Verify that this would be
 so.

\item[5826:] ``prele'' (7882) is used to
 ``unlock'' ``inodes''. Where, you
 may ask, did the ``inode'' get
 ``locked'', and why?

\item[5827:] Note that ``falloc'' (6847) calls
 ``ufalloc'' (6824) as the first
 thing it does;

\item[5831:] ``ufalloc'' leaves
 the user file
identifying number
``u.u\_ar0[R0]''. Why does this
statement occur where it does,
instead of after line 5834?

\item[5832:] ``openi'' (6702) is called to call
 handlers for special files, in
 case any device specific actions
 are required (for disk files
 there is no action);

\item[5839:] In the case of an error while
 making the ``file'' array entry,
 the ``inode'' entry is released by
 a call on ``iput''.
\ed

It will be seen that responsibility is
quite widely distributed. The ``file''
table entry is initialised by ``falloc''
and ``open1''; the ``inode'' table entry,
by ``iget'', ``ialloc'' and ``maknode''.

Note that ``ialloc'' clears out the
``i\_addr'' array of a newly allocated
``inode'' and ``itrunc'' does the same for
a pre-existing ``inode'', so that after
the ``creat'' system call, there are no
disk blocks associated with the file,
now classed as ``small''.


\sbs{open (5763)}

We now turn to consider the case where
a program wishes to reference a file
which already exists.

``namei'' is called (5770) with a second
parameter of zero to locate the named
file. (``u.u\_arg[0]'' contains the
address in the user space of a character string which defines a file path
name.)

``u.u\_arg[1]'' has to be incremented by
one, because there is a mismatch
between the user programming conventions and the internal data representations.)


\sbs{open1 revisited}

``trf'' is now zero, so access permissions are checked (5813) but the existing file (if any) is not deallocated
(5824).

What is a little disconcerting here is
that, apart from the call on ``falloc''
(5827), there is no direct call on any
of the ``resource allocation'' routines.
Of course, for an existing file, neither directory entry nor disk ``inode''
entry nor disk blocks need be allocated. The core ``inode'' entry is allocated (if necessary) as a side-effect
of the call on ``namei'', but ... where
is it initialised?


\sbs{close (5846)}

The ``close'' system call is used to
sever explicitly the connection between
a user program and a file and thus can
be regarded as the inverse of ``open''.


The user program's file identification
is passed via r0. The value is validated by
``getf'' (6619), the ``u.u\_ofile''
entry is erased, and a call is made on ``closef''.


\sbs{closef (6643)}

``closef'' is called by ``close'' (5854)
and by ``exit'' (3230). (The latter is
more common since most files do not get
closed explicitly but only implicitly
when the user program terminates.)


\bd
\item[6649:] If the file is a pipe, reset the
mode of the pipe and ``wakeup'' any
process which is waiting for the
pipe, either for information or
for space;

\item[6655:] If this is the last process to
 reference the file, call ``closei''
 (6672) to handle any special end
 of file processing for special
 files and then call ``iput'';

\item[6657:] Decrement the ``file'' entry reference count. If this now zero, the
 entry is no longer allocated.
\ed

\sbs{iput (7344)}


``closei'', as its last action calls
``iput''. This routine is in fact called
from many places, whenever a connection
to a core ``inode'' is to be severed and
the reference count decremented.


\bd
\item[7350:] If the reference count is one at
 this point, the ``inode'' is to be
 released. While this is happening, it should be locked.

 \item[7352:] If the number of ``links'' to the
 file is zero (or less) the file
 is to be deallocated (see below);

\item[7357:] ``iupdat'' (7374) updates the
 accessed and update times as
recorded on the disk ``inode'';

\item[7358:] ``prele'' unlocks the ``inode''. Why
 should it be called here as well
 as at line 7363?
\ed

\sbs{Deletion of Files}


New files are automatically entered
into the file directory as permanent
files as soon as they are ``opened''.
Subsequent ``closing'' of a file does not
automatically cause its deletion. As
was seen at line 7352, deletion will
occur when the field ``i\_nlink'' of the
core ``inode'' entry is zero. This field
is set to one initially by ``maknode''
(7464) when the file is first created.
It may be incremented by the system
call ``link'' (5941) and decremented by
the system call ``unlink'' (3529).


Programs which create temporary ``work
files'' should remove these files before
terminating, by executing an ``unlink''
system call. Note that the ``unlink''
call does not of itself remove the
file. This can only happen when the
reference count (``i\_count'') is about to
be decremented to zero (7350, 7362).

To minimise the problems associated
with ``temporary'' files which survive
program or system crashes, programmers
should observe the conventions that:

\bd
\item[(a)] temporary files should be
 ``unlinked'' immediately after
 they are opened;

\item[(b)] temporary files should always be
 placed in the ``tmp'' directory.
 Unique file names can be generated by incorporating the
 process's identifying number into the file name (See ``getpid''
 (3480)).
\ed

\sbs{Reading and Writing}

It is of interest to work through an
abbreviated summary of the code which
is invoked when a user process performs
a ``read'' system call before examining
the code in detail.

\begin{verbatim}
   .... read (f, b, n); /*user program/

                 {trap occurs}
   2693 trap

                 {system call #3}
   5711 read ();
   5713   rdwr (PREAD);
\end{verbatim}



Execution of the system call by the
user process results in the activation
of ``trap'' running in kernel mode.
``trap'' recognises system call \#3, and
calls (via ``trap1'') the routine ``read'',
which calls ``rdwr''.

\begin{verbatim}
  5731 rdwr

  5736 fp = getf (u.u_ar0[R0];
  5743 u.u_base = u.u_arg[0];
  5744 u.u_count = u.u_arg[1];
  5745 u.u_segflg = 0;
  5751 u.u_offset[1] = f2->f_offset[1];
  5752 u.u_offset[0] = fp->f_offset[0];
  5754 readi(fp->f inode);
  5756 dpadd(fp->f_offset,
              u.u_arg[1]-u.u_count);
\end{verbatim}

``rdwr'' includes much code which is common to both ``read'' and ``write'' operations. It converts, via ``getf'' (6619),
the file identification supplied by the
user process into the address of an
entry in the ``file'' array.

Note that the first parameter of the
system call is passed in a different
way from the remaining two parameters.


``u.u\_segflg'' is set to zero to indicate
that the operation destination is in
the user address space. After ``readi''
is called with a parameter which is an
``inode'' pointer, the final accounting
is performed by adding the number of
characters requested for transfer less
the residual number not transferred
(left in ``u.u\_count'') to the file
offset.

\begin{verbatim}
  6221 readi

  6239 lbn = lshift (u.u_offset, -9);
  6240 on = u.u_offset[1] & 0777;
  6241 n = min (512 - on, u.u_count);
  6248 bn = bmap(ip, lbn);
  6250 dn = ip->i_dev;
  6258 bp = bread (dn, bn);
  6260 iomove (bp, on, n, B READ);
  6261 brelse (bp);

\end{verbatim}

``readi'' converts the file offset into
two parts: a logical block number,
``lbn'', and an index into the block,
``on''. The number of characters to be
transferred is the minimum of
``u.u\_count'' and the number of characters left in the block (in which case
additional block(s) must be read (not
shown)) (and the number of characters
remaining in the file (this case is not
shown)).

``dn'' is the device number which is
stored within the ``inode''. ``bn'' is the
actual block number on the device
(disk), which is computed by ``bmap''
(6415) using ``lbn''.

The call on ``bread'' finds the required
block, copying it into core from disk
if necessary. ``iomove'' (6364)
transfers the appropriate characters to
their destination, and performs
accounting chores.



\sbs{rdwr (5731)}

``read'' and ``write'' perform similar
operations and share much code. The
two system calls, ``read'' (5711) and
``write'' (5720), call ``rdwr'' immediately
to:

\bd
\item[5736:] Convert the user program file
 identification to a pointer in
 the file table;

\item[5739:] Check that the operation (read or
 write) is in accordance with the
 mode with which the file was
 opened;

\item[5743:] Set up various standard locations
 in ``u'' with the appropriate
 parameters;

\item[5746:] ``pipes'' get special treatment
 right from the start!

\item[5755:] Call ``readi'' or ``writei'' as
 appropriate;

 \item[5756:] Update the file offset by, and
set the value returned to the
user program to, the number of
characters actually transferred.
\ed

\sbs{readi (6221)}

\bd
\item[6230:] If no characters are to be
transferred, do nothing;

\item[6232:] Set the ``inode'' flag to indicate
that the ``inode'' has been accessed;

\item[6233:] If the file is a character special file, call the appropriate
 device ``read'' procedure, passing
 the device identification as
 parameter;

\item[6238:] Begin a loop to transfer data in
 amounts up to 512 characters at a
 time until (6262) either an irrecoverable error condition has
 been encountered or the requested
 number of characters has been
 transferred;

\item[6239:] ``lshift'' (1410) concatenates the
 two words of the array
 ``u.u\_offset'', shifts right by
 nine places, and truncates to 16
 bits. This defines the ``logical
block number'' of the file which
is to be referenced;

\item[6240:] ``on'' is a character offset within
 the block;

\item[6241:] ``n'' is determined initially as
the minimum of the number of
characters beyond ``on'' in the
block, and the number requested
for transfer. (Note that ``min''
(6339) treats its arguments as
unsigned integers.)

\item[6242:] If the file is not a special
 block file then ...

\item[6243:] Compare the file offset with the
 current file size;

\item[6246:] Reset ``n'' as the minimum of the
 characters requested and the
 remaining characters in the file;

\item[6248:] Call ``bmap'' to convert the logical block number for the file to
 a physical block number for its
 host device. There will be more
 on ``bmap'' shortly. For now, note
 that ``bmap'' sets ``rablock'' as a
 side effect;

\item[6250:] Set ``dn'' as the device identification from the ``inode'';

\item[6251:] If the file is a special block
 file then ...

\item[6252:] Set ``dn'' from the ``i\_addr'' field
 of the ``inode'' entry. (Presumably
 this will nearly always be the
 same as the ``i\_dev'' field, so why
 the distinction?)

\item[6253:] Set the ``read ahead block'' to the
 next physical block;

\item[6255:] If the blocks of the file are
 apparently being read sequentially then ...

\item[6256:] Call ``breada'' to read the desired
 block and to initiate reading of
 the ``read ahead block'';

\item[6258:] else just read the desired block;

\item[6260:] Call ``iomove'' to transfer information from the buffer to the
 user area;

\item[6261:] Return the buffer to the
 ``av''-list.
\ed


\sbs{writei}

\bd
\item[6303:] If less than a full block is
 being written the previous contents of the buffer must be read
 so that the appropriate part can
 be preserved, otherwise just get
 any available buffer;

\item[6311:] There is no ``write ahead'' facility, but there is a ``delayed
 write'' for buffers whose final
 characters have not been changed;

\item[6312:] If the file offset now points
 beyond the recorded end of file
 character, the file has obviously
 grown bigger!

\item[6318:] Why is it necessary/desirable to
 set the ``IUPD'' flag again? (See
 line 6285.)
\ed


\sbs{iomove (6364)}

The comment at the beginning of this
procedure says most of what needs to be
said. ``copyin'', ``copyout'', ``cpass'' and
``passc'' may be found at lines 1244,
1252, 6542 and 6517 respectively.


\sbs{bmap (6415)}

A general description of the function
of ``bmap'' may be found on Page 2 of
``FILE SYSTEM (V)'' of the UPM.

\bd
\item[6423:] Files of more than 2**15 blocks
 (2**24 characters) are not supported;

\item[6427:] Start with the ``small'' file algorithm (file is not greater than
 eight blocks i.e. 4096 characters);

\item[6431:] If the block number is 8 or more,
the ``small'' file must converted
into a large file. Note this is
a side effect of ``bmap'', and
should occur only when ``bmap'' has
been called by ``writei'' (and
never by ``readi'' -- see line
6245). Thus all files start life
as ``small'' files and are never
explicitly changed to ``large''
files. Note also that the change
is irreversible!

\item[6435:] ``alloc'' (6956) allocates a block
on device ``d'' from the device's
free list. It then assigns a
buffer to this block and returns
a pointer to the buffer header;

\item[6438:] The eight buffer addresses in the
``i\_addr'' array for the ``inode''
are copied into the buffer area
and then erased;

\item[6442:] ``i\_addr[0]'' is set to point to
 the buffer which is set up for a
 ``delayed'' write;

\item[6448:] The file is still small. Get the
next block if necessary;

\item[6456:] Note the setting of ``rablock'';
\ed

\sbs{Leftovers}

You should investigate the following
procedures for yourself:

\begin{verbatim}
   seek  (5861)   stat1 (6045)
   sslep (5979)   dup   (6069)
   fstat (6014)   owner (6791)
   stat  (6028)   suser (6811)
\end{verbatim}
